# ðŸ“Š Final Evaluation - Module 3

## Description

Welcome to my Final Evaluation for Module 3! This assessment will showcase my understanding and skills related to the topics covered in this module.

## Evaluation Phases

**Phase 1: Exploration and Data Cleaning**

Initial Exploration:

I will start by exploring the data to identify any potential issues such as null values, outliers, or missing data.

Using Pandas, I will analyze the data structure, check for null values, and review basic statistics for the columns involved.

I will efficiently merge the two datasets.

Data Cleaning:

I will handle or remove null values in key columns to ensure data completeness.

I will verify the consistency and correctness of the data.

Any necessary adjustments or conversions (e.g., changing data types) will be made to prepare the data for statistical analysis.

**Phase 2: Visualization**

Using the visualization techniques Iâ€™ve learned, I will create charts to answer the following questions:

How are the flights booked distributed across the months?

Is there a relationship between flight distance and points accumulated by customers?

How are customers distributed by province or state?

How does the average salary compare across different educational levels of customers?

What is the proportion of customers with different types of loyalty cards?

How are customers distributed by marital status and gender?

**Phase 3: Evaluating Differences in Flight Bookings by Education Level**

Objective: Determine if there are significant differences in the number of flights booked based on the educational level of customers.

Data Preparation:

I will filter the dataset to include only the relevant columns: 'Flights Booked' and 'Education'.

Descriptive Analysis:

I will group the data by educational level and calculate basic descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, percentiles) for the number of flights booked in each group.

Statistical Testing:

I will conduct an A/B test to determine if there is a significant difference in the number of flights booked among different educational levels.

## Evaluation Criteria
To pass the evaluation, I must meet at least 80% of the criteria. Key criteria (marked with *) must be met. Failing to meet these criteria will result in a re-evaluation to ensure I am better prepared for my professional career.

Criteria:

Data Analysis and Transformation

EDA Understanding *

Pandas Methods *

Data Cleaning, including the use of "apply" for data transformation *

Visualization: Creating and interpreting graphs *

ETL Process and Pipeline

A/B Testing
